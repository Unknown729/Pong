This is a prototype of game Pong where I learn how to utilize Godot Game Engine and learning C# where you noticed that this does not work entirely because I am still learning how to resolve this Ball spawn randomizer and somehow it works in Unity vs not working in Godot game engine.... See Pong - Unity where I am able to make this work and published Pong game on Itch.io
